# Advaita Vedanta Philosophy Conversation Dataset

This repository maintains a growing dataset of conversations based on Advaita Vedantic texts. The dataset is designed to provide a conversational format between a **Master (M)** and a **Questioner (Q)** to explore core concepts of Advaita Vedanta philosophy. This repository will be periodically updated with additional conversations as the dataset expands over time. 

**This dataset has been used to fine-tune a Gemma model to help it learn the Advait Vedantic context. You can find the notebook here: https://github.com/Rohit0812/AVModel**

The dataset is aimed at:
- Offering machine learning practitioners a valuable resource for training language models focused on philosophical dialogue.
- Enabling discussions on deep philosophical topics in a structured conversational format.
