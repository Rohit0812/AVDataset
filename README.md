# Advaita Vedanta Philosophy Conversation Dataset

This repository maintains a growing dataset of conversations based on Advaita Vedantic texts. The dataset is designed to provide a conversational format between a **Master (M)** and a **Questioner (Q)** to explore core concepts of Advaita Vedanta philosophy. This repository will be periodically updated with additional conversations as the dataset expands over time. 

**This dataset has been used to finetune a gemma model to make it learn Advait Vedantic context.**

The dataset is structured as follows:

- **Folder: `data/`**
  - Contains text files of individual conversations.
  - **`1.txt`**: A sample conversation between **M (Master)** and **Q (Questioner)**. Each conversation is an exchange of questions and answers, based on Advaita Vedantic texts.
